# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in JavaScript

Object-Oriented Programming is a programming paradigm that organizes code into objects, which are instances of classes. It provides a way to structure and design software using objects that contain data and code. Here are the key concepts of OOP:

1. **Classes**: Blueprints for creating objects. They encapsulate data and behavior.

2. **Objects**: Instances of classes that contain data and methods.

3. **Encapsulation**: The bundling of data and the methods that operate on that data within a single unit (object).

4. **Inheritance**: A mechanism that allows a class to inherit properties and methods from another class.

5. **Polymorphism**: The ability of objects of different classes to respond to the same method call in different ways.

6. **Abstraction**: The process of hiding complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features of an object.

## Benefits of OOP:

- Modularity: Encapsulation allows objects to be self-contained, making the code more modular and easier to maintain.
- Reusability: Through inheritance, code can be reused, reducing redundancy.
- Flexibility: Polymorphism allows for more flexible and extensible code.
- Organization: OOP provides a clear structure for programs, making them easier to understand and manage.
