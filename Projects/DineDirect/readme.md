# DineDirect

DineDirect is a sleek and intuitive food delivery app UI built with React and Parcel. This project showcases a seamless and user-friendly experience for ordering food from local restaurants, leveraging real-time data from the Swiggy API. **(Note: This project uses a Swiggy API; you will need to obtain your own API key to use it.)**

## Project Highlights

- **Purpose:** Developed to enhance frontend development skills.
- **Origin:** Created during a Frontend Mentor internship, focusing on modern web development practices.

## Features

1. **Simple Ordering:** Users can browse the menu and place orders easily.
2. **Dynamic Menu:** The menu is loaded from an API and can change dynamically. It can be filtered using functions (e.g., by Delivery Time, Ratings, etc.).
3. **Cart Functionality:** Users can add multiple items to a cart before placing an order.

## Tech Stack

1. **React:** Component-based architecture for building a modular and maintainable frontend.
2. **Parcel:** Blazing fast, zero configuration web application bundler.
3. **React Router:** Declarative routing for dynamic and accessible navigation.
4. **Tailwind CSS:** Utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
5. **Redux Toolkit:** Efficient and scalable state management for complex applications.
6. **Axios:** For making HTTP requests to the Swiggy API.
7. **React Icons:** For using icons in the UI.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```
   Replace <repository_url> with the actual URL of the GitHub repository.
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd DineDirect
   ```
3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. **Start the development server:**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   This will start the Parcel development server, and you can access the app in your browser at http://localhost:1234 (or the port specified by Parcel).

5. **Build for production:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
   This will create an optimized build in the dist folder.

(Remember to replace <repository_url> with the actual Git repository URL.) You'll also need to obtain a Swiggy API key and configure the application to use it. The API key is not included in this repository for security reasons. Look for instructions within the source code on how to set up your API key.
